Pre-requistes:
Jenkins Master is already setup and running

Steps involved:
1. Setup EC2 instance for slave
2. Create jenkins user and Install Java, Maven in Slave node
3. upload public keys from master to slave node.
4. verify ssh connection from master to slave
5. Register slave node in Jenkins master
6. Run build jobs in Jenkins slave


Slave node configuration
(You need to use new micro or small Ubuntu instance for this slave)
only port 22 needs to be open

Install Java

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install default-jdk -y

sudo cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Now Login to Slave node and execute the below command
sudo -u jenkins vi /home/jenkins/.ssh/authorized_keys

Now go into master node
ssh jenkins@slave_node_ip


Now copy the SSH keys into /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh by executing below command in master(make sure you exited from slave by typing exit command:

sudo cp ~/.ssh/known_hosts  /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh   ( in master)

sudo cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa(private key of jenkins server)
(Make sure you copy the whole key including the below without missing anything)
